 * Even though Npcap source code is publicly available for review, it is   *
 * not open source software and may not be redistributed or incorporated   *

 * We fund the Npcap project by selling a commercial license which allows  *
 * companies to redistribute Npcap with their products and also provides   *
 * for support, warranty, and indemnification rights.  For details on      *
 * obtaining such a license, please contact:                               *

 * Free and open source software producers are also welcome to contact us  *
 * for redistribution requests.  However, we normally recommend that such  *
 * authors instead ask your users to download and install Npcap            *
 * themselves.                                                             *

 * Since the Npcap source code is available for download and review,       *
 * users sometimes contribute code patches to fix bugs or add new          *
 * features.  By sending these changes to the Nmap Project (including      *
 * through direct email or our mailing lists or submitting pull requests   *
 * through our source code repository), it is understood unless you        *
 * specify otherwise that you are offering the Nmap Project the            *
 * unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicence your     *
 * code contribution so that we may (but are not obligated to)             *
 * incorporate it into Npcap.  If you wish to specify special license      *
 * conditions or restrictions on your contributions, just say so when you  *
 * send them.                                                              *
