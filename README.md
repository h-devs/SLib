# SLib

SLib is a universal cross-platform library, specially designed for the various UI components, OpenGL rendering and networking solutions.

SLib enables software developers to build multi-platform(Android/iOS/MacOS/Tizen/Win32) applications and games under the most effective workflows and the coding conventions of C++, while providing easy-to-use toolkits to develop HTTP/Socket servers on the Linux/MacOS/Win32 platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 * Xcode 9.4 or higher for compiling macOS/iOS packages
 * Android Studio 3.2 or higher for compiling Android packages
 * Visual Studio 2017 or higher for compiling Win32 packages
 * Tizen Studio 1.1.1 or higher for compiling Tizen packages
 * CMake (>=3.0), GCC/C++ (>=4.8.1) for compiling Linux packages. Optional: KDevelop(>=4.7)

### Clone the repository from Github.

 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SLIBIO/SLib.git
 ```

### Build the static libraries

You can see the following projects in `build` directory.

| Project| Description |
| ----|----|
| Android | Android Studio project for Android |
| iOS | Xcode project for iOS |
| macOS | Xcode project for macOS |
| Win32 | Visual Studio solution for Win32 |
| Tizen | Tizen Studio project for Tizen |
| Linux | CMake/KDevelop project for Linux |
 
 After compiling the projects, you can find the static libraries in the `lib` directory.

### Setup Environment

It's time to setup the environment variables. It is a bit different depending on the platforms.

On macOS and Linux, you'll need to run the `setup-path` script on Terminal or Finder.

 ```bash
  ./setup-path
 ```

On Windows, you'll need to run the `setup-path.bat` batch file on Command Prompt or File Explorer.

 ```bash
  setup-path.bat
 ```

`setup-path` will register the current source directory as `SLIB-PATH` environment variable depending on the Operating Systems and IDEs(XCode and KDevelop).

After setting up the environment variables, please close all the running IDEs(Xcode, Android Studio, Tizen Studio,...) and terminal (or konsole) windows, and then reopen them. (on macOS, press Command+Q to completely close the IDEs).


### Creating new projects based on SLib

After setting up environment using `setup-path`(`setup-path.bat`), please reopen `Terminal` (`Command Prompt`) window.

And then please create an empty directory, and then create a C++ project using following commands.

| Platform | Application Type | Command |
| ----|----|----|
| Android <br/> iOS | Mobile App <br/>(With `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-mobile YOUR_PROJECT_NAME YOUR_APPLICATION_ID` |
| macOS <br/> Win32 | Desktop App <br/>(With `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-desktop YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| Android | Mobile App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-android YOUR_PROJECT_NAME YOUR_APPLICATION_ID` |
| iOS | Mobile App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-ios YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| macOS | Desktop App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-macos YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| macOS | Console App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-console-macos YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| Win32 | Desktop App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-win32 YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| Win32 | Console App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-console-win32 YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| Linux | Desktop App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-app-linux YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |
| Linux | Console App <br/>(Without `sapp`) | `new-slib-console-linux YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` |

Note that you have to compile SLib before creating new SLib application projects.

Here is an example for creating a mobile app project.

```
mkdir ~/SLibMobileExample
cd ~/SLibMobileExample
new-slib-app-mobile Test org.example.testapp
```

To preview the user interface xml files

```
cd src/sapp/ui
sapp LaunchScreen
sapp MainPage
```


Here is an example for creating a desktop app project.

```
mkdir ~/SLibDesktopExample
cd ~/SLibDesktopExample
new-slib-app-desktop Test
```


Here is an example for creating an Android project.

```
mkdir ~/SLibAndroidExample
cd ~/SLibAndroidExample
new-slib-app-android Test org.example.testapp
```

Here is an example for creating a macOS Desktop project.

```
mkdir ~/SLibMacOSExample
cd ~/SLibMacOSExample
new-slib-app-macos Test
```

After creating projects, you can share same source code across the projects by adding same sources using IDE.


## Integrating SLib with existing C++ projects

It is very easy to integrate `SLib` into your existing C++ project. You just need to setup `include` and `lib` directories into your existing C++ project.

| Platform | IDE | Include Directory | Link Directory |
| ----|----|----|----|
| Android | Android Studio (CMake) | ${SLIB_PATH}/include | ${SLIB_PATH}/lib/Android/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}-${ANDROID_ABI} |
| iOS | Xcode | $(SLIB_PATH)/include | $(SLIB_PATH)/lib/iOS/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME) |
| Tizen | Tizen Studio | ${SLIB_PATH}/include | ${SLIB_PATH}/lib/Tizen/${ConfigName}-${SDK_ARCH} |
| macOS | Xcode | $(SLIB_PATH)/include | $(SLIB_PATH)/lib/macOS/$(CONFIGURATION) |
| Win32 | Visual Studio | $(SLIB_PATH)/include | $(SLIB_PATH)/lib/Win32/$(Configuration)-$(Platform) |
| Linux | CMake, KDevelop | ${SLIB_PATH}/include | ${SLIB_PATH}/lib/Linux/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}-${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR} |

You can also integrate SLib into any types of C++ projects using similar `include` and `lib` directory rules.

`Important:` Your C++ project must be compiled with C++11 support.

After setup directories, link `slib` library via IDE or set `-lslib` option to the linker.

To make your project more portable, you can copy the include directory and the precompiled static libraries into your project and use the relative path instead of the environment variable.

### Android Studio (using CMake)

Firstly, open and build the project in the `build/Android` directory in the SLib source. After completion of build, you can see the precompiled static libraries and `slib.aar` in the `lib/Android` directory.

Secondly, open your Android project created by yourself which will use SLib.

`Important:` Use gradle version 2.3.1 or higher.

Edit the `build.gradle` in your app module as following.

```
  ...
  android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
      ...
      externalNativeBuild {
        ...
        cmake {
          cppFlags "-std=c++11"
          arguments "-DSLIB_PATH=${System.env.SLIB_PATH}"
        }
        ...
      }
      ndk {
        abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
      }

      ...
    }
  }
  ...
  repositories {
    ...
    flatDir{
       ...
       dirs "${System.env.SLIB_PATH}/lib/Android"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    ...
    compile ':slib@aar'
  }
  
```


Edit `CMakeLists.txt` in your app module as following.

```
  ...
  include_directories (${SLIB_PATH}/include)
  link_directories (${SLIB_PATH}/lib/Android/${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}-${ANDROID_ABI})
  ...
  target_link_libraries (
    your-native-module-name
    ...
    slib
    log GLESv2 OpenSLES
    ...
  )
  ...
```

Edit the main cpp file (for example, `native-lib.cpp`), and insert the following code snippet.

```
#include <slib/core/platform_android.h>

JNIEXPORT jint JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* jvm, void* reserved)
{
	slib::Android::initialize(jvm);
	return JNI_VERSION_1_4;
}
```

If you already defined `JNI_OnLoad` in somewhere, please insert `slib::Android::initialize(jvm);` in the existing definition, instead of inserting above code snippet.


### Xcode (iOS, macOS)
